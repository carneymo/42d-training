# Puzzle 1 - The Case of the Missing Consonants

Detective John is investigating a series of thefts in the city. The thief always seems to be one step ahead of the police, and Detective John is determined to catch him.

One day, Detective John receives a letter from an anonymous source:

    Dear Detective John,

    I hope this letter finds you well. I wanted to give you a heads up on a 
    potential target for the thief you are pursuing. I have reason to believe 
    that the next theft will take place at a location where the name starts
    with a vowel and ends with a consonant.

    Here are some locations that the thief might target:

        The Art Institute of Chicago
        The Metropolitan Museum of Art
        The British Museum
        The Louvre Museum
        The Museum of Modern Art
        The National Museum of Natural History

    I hope this information is helpful to you. Please let me know if you have 
    any questions or if there's anything else I can do to assist with your investigation.

    Sincerely,
    Anonymous

Detective John is intrigued by the letter, and uses his knowledge of regular expressions to find the potential target locations. Where does he need to go to catch the thief?
