# Puzzle 2 - The Case of the Secret Meeting

Detective John receives yet another letter from the anonymous source:

    Dear Detective John,

    I have more information about the thief's activities. I discovered that the thief 
    is planning a secret meeting with an accomplice at a café. However, they're using 
    a code to specify the café's name in their communication. I managed to get a list 
    of potential cafés where the meeting could take place, but I need your help to 
    identify the correct one.

    "Start with the third letter and ends in the 19th letter
    but naught only 6 letters in length it has
    with the 18th letter between them."

    Here's the list of potential cafés:

    - Bonjour Bistro
    - Cristo Coffee House
    - Caviar Lounge
    - Carters Pub
    - Atlantic Eats Restaurant
    - Citrus Coffee House
    - Café Le Carols
    - Poppy Fields Diner
    - Charms Kitchen
    - Corners Pub
    - The Brewers Eatery
    - Café D'Cribs
    - Carrera Bakery
    - Cask Bar
    - Crusts Bistro
    - Champs Eatery
    - Ceilidh Corner
    - Chocolat Restaurant

    Please use your knowledge of regular expressions to find the correct café.

    Best of luck,
