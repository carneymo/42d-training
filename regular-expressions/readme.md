# Regular Expressions

Welcome to the wonderful world of Regular Expressions, or as it's more commonly known as <strong>regex</strong>.

## What is a Regular Expression?

A regular expression is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. Usually this pattern is then used by string searching algorithms for "find" or "find and replace" operations on strings.

## Why use Regular Expressions?

Regular expressions are extremely powerful and can be used to do a lot of things. They can be used to validate input, search for patterns in text, and even replace text. They are supported in most programming languages and are a great tool to have in your tool belt.
